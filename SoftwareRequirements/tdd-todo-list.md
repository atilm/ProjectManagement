[x] extract velocity calculation from given list of tasks
[x] completed stories are sorted by algorithm
[x] extract number restriction in velocity calculation from graph_generator and report_generator
[x] at most n recent stories are used for velocity calculation
[x] no error calculation possible for < 2 completed tasks
[x] completed task without velocity (no estimate, no duration) at beginning, middle, end
[x] first story has no velocity
[x] plot the errors
[x] extract FreeRange into own module as it is used by WorkingDaysRepository and GraphData
[ ] use velocity warnings in report generator
[ ] refactor build of unique project dictionary
[ ] do not generate report twice when an output file is requested
